>### Libraries use
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

>### Project motivation
Currently living in San Francisco, I made this analysis to determine what is the safest county to be at when the lockdown will be eased. But also what are the ones that should not ease their lockdown policy anytime soon. This is what pushed me to explore the dataset of COVID-19 by counties and try to answer these questions.
>### Files in the repository
- us_counties.csv :  The dataset file.
- COVID-19 California Analysis.ipynb : Notebook file contaning the exploration and analysis of the work.
- readme.md : The readme file for write-up.

>### Summary of the results
- Sacramento, Santa Clara, and Contra Costa with their low infection rate and a significant decrease in new cases are the safest counties to re-open.
- Santa Barbara and Los Angeles should not ease its lockdown policy.
