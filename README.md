- Currently living in San Francisco, I was interesting into looking what is the safest county to be at when the lockdown will be eased. This is what pushed me to explore the dataset of COVID-19 by counties and try to answer these questions:

Is it safe to re-open California?
Which county should not re-open?
What are the counties that should ease their lockdown policy
