# COVID19
Is it safe to reopen California?
 
For this analysis, I will use the dataset of COVID-19 by counties retrieved from Kaggle. The focus of this analysis will be on the state of California that has around 70,000 cases and 3,000 deaths. 
Number of cases and deaths in California from January to May

After exploring the data, I came up with few questions or topics of interest:
- What is the first county that should reopen in California?
- Which county should not ease its lock down policy?
- What is the first county that should reopen in California?
